# Face-recognisation-and-celebrity-predictions

The project aimed to develop a face recognition and celebrity prediction system. It began by constructing a dataframe from image data, extracting relevant features for analysis. To manage the dataset's complexity, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was employed for dimensionality reduction, followed by the application of Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) to address categorical aspects within the target variables. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) were then utilized to train the model, leveraging their ability to effectively learn complex patterns from images. To ensure the model's robustness and accuracy, it was rigorously tested using imposter data, evaluating its performance under varied conditions. Through this comprehensive approach, the project aimed to create a reliable and efficient system for face recognition and celebrity prediction, with potential applications in security, entertainment, and beyond.
